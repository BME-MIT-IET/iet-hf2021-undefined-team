# Manual Testing

The second technique that we decided to work with after Unit Testing was Manual Testing. The purpose of manual testing is to check if all the modules of a given library are working properly with human-designed inputs. The input data-types which we used for manual testing purpose are following:

- Integer
- Float
- Double
- String

All the ratings must be positive as we can not have any negaticve ratings but rather closer to zero shows a lower rating!

## **Integer Test**:


Providing integer values:

## **Float Test**:

Providing float values:

As you can see above we provide float values as raw inputs and the resulting ratings changed.

## **Double Test**:

Providing double values:

As you can see above we provide double values as raw inputs and the resulting ratings changed remained similar to float but different from integer.

 ## **String Test**:

Providing string values:

From the above attachment, as you see we provide the string values which didn't get accept by the program and generates an error for the user that inputs like these are not acceptable.
